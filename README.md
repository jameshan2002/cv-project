# CV-Project

A CV application using react JS.
I made this application has been made to practice props and state and how it is implemented in React JS.
It was finalized by using Bootstrap to give a visualization of the application.



# What is used
- React JS
- Bootstrap
- npm
- git



# What I have learned
It was really hard for me to implement props and state in different situation. I have learned how to use bootstrap which helped me a lot. It could be better by adding editing function and more, but I feel like I need to learn more to implement those.
